// The snow-surf wake.
//
// The mesh carries no geometry: `position` is (column, row, side) and every
// vertex is placed here from the spine data texture, exactly as the spray
// billboards are. So a wake that is 19 m long one frame and 2 m long the next
// costs the same static vertex buffer and one 3 x 96 texture upload.
//
// Normals come from differencing the surface rather than from an analytic
// tangent frame. The surface is a sweep with a per-sample amplitude envelope, a
// backward shear and a lump field on top, and the analytic normal for all of
// that together is both long and easy to get subtly wrong. Three evaluations of
// `wakePoint` cost less than the vertex shader spends on the spine fetch, and
// they cannot disagree with the geometry because they *are* the geometry.

    // The `* side` is not cosmetic, and leaving it out is a bug that hides.

    // The two walls are mirror images, and mirroring a parametric surface
    // reverses the handedness of its tangent pair — so `cross(Pq, Pu)` points to
    // the concave side of the right-hand wall and to the *convex* side of the
    // left-hand one. The fragment shader turns the normal toward the eye before
    // shading, so the lit result looked fine and the error was invisible in the
    // BRDF. What it was not invisible in was the one thing that asks the normal
    // which side of the sheet it is on: the barrel occlusion landed on the open
    // outer face of the left wall and left the inside of the curl unshaded. One
    // wall dark on the wrong side, the other correct — which is exactly how it
