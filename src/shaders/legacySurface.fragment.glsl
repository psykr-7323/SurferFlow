// The snow material.

// Normals arrive from four independent sources and have to be combined in the
// right order or the surface stops holding together:
//
//   macro     baked landform gradient        tens of metres → ~1 m
//   fine      analytic sastrugi and ripples  ~2 m → ~10 cm
//   detail    tiled generated grain map      ~10 cm → ~5 mm
//   deform    the terrain state buffer       whatever the player carved
//
// Macro and fine and deform are all *heightfield gradients* in world space, so
// they add as slopes before ever becoming a normal. Only the detail map is a
// tangent-space normal, and it is folded in last with reoriented normal mapping.
// Adding normals instead of slopes is the classic way to lose the landform under
// the detail.
