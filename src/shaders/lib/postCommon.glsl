// One place for the coordinate agreement, because getting it wrong is silent:
// a vertically mirrored depth lookup still produces plausible-looking occlusion,
// it is just occlusion belonging to a different part of the frame, and that is
// exactly the class of bug that costs a day.
//
// The agreement, derived once:
//
//   Babylon's GLSL processor multiplies `position.y` by an internal `yFactor` of
//   -1 when the destination is a render target, and compensates in the fragment
//   stage when it is not. The net effect is that `vUV` and
//   `position.xy / renderSize` are the *same* number in every
//   pass, and both run bottom-up: vUV.y = 1 is the top of the image. So NDC y in
//   the ordinary, unflipped sense is `vUV.y * 2 - 1`, and a world point projected
//   with `scene.getTransformMatrix()` lands at `ndc * 0.5 + 0.5` — no flip
//   anywhere, as long as nothing in this file invents one.
//
// View space is left-handed with +z forward, matching the camera.
