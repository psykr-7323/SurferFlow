// Three consumers sample this: the snow vertex shader (displacement), the shadow
// depth vertex shader (so carved snow casts its own shadow), and the snow
// fragment shader (normals and surface state). They must agree exactly — if the

// acne against its own floor. Hence one include rather than three copies.
//
// Addressing is toroidal. The buffer is never scrolled or copied; the window
// simply re-interprets which world position each texel stands for, so the UV is
// just the world position wrapped into one window.

/// The filter is not optional polish — without it the surf groove tears itself
/// into a row of triangular peaks. The clipmap rings are centred on the *camera*,
/// so orbiting or zooming slides a ring boundary across a stationary trail: the
/// same patch of snow gets re-sampled from 0.085 m spacing to 0.34 m, and a
/// 0.6 m-wide groove with a narrower berm crest ends up with less than one vertex
/// across its ridge. Each triangle then spans the whole berm and the ridge
/// collapses into facets that swim as the camera moves. Fading the displacement
/// out with distance hides it but also deletes the trail; filtering fixes it.
///
/// A separable 3x3 binomial with taps one `spacing` apart puts the filter's first
/// zero exactly at the lattice Nyquist (wavelength 2 x spacing), so content the
/// vertices cannot represent is removed rather than aliased, while a broad trench
/// at 8 x spacing still passes at 85%. Because `spacing` is continuous through
/// the CDLOD morph, so is the filter — two rings meeting at a shared vertex
/// compute the same width and the same height, and the mesh stays crack-free.
///
/// Cost is close to free in practice: the whole clipmap is 870 m across and the
/// deformation window is 80 m, so the falloff test rejects the overwhelming
/// majority of vertices before a single fetch.
