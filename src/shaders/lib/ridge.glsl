// The constraint is that the range must never read as flat, and that is what
// rules out the two cheap answers. A silhouette cut out of the sky reads as a
// sticker. A band
// of noise shaded by its own azimuth gradient reads as corrugated cardboard,
// because a ridge's *form* comes from slopes facing toward and away from the sun,
// and a one-dimensional profile has no such thing.
//
// So this raymarches an actual two-dimensional heightfield, on the skybox, in
// world space. It costs nothing in geometry, it is behind everything by
// construction, and because the field is real:
//
//   * ridges occlude other ridges, so the range has depth rather than a single
//     outline;
//   * the normal is analytic, so faces light and shade correctly against the low
//     sun;
//   * a short second march toward the sun gives the range its own cast shadows,
//     which is most of what makes a mountain read as a solid rather than a
//     gradient;
//   * extinction is integrated per pixel over the true distance, so nearer
//     massifs sit in front of hazier ones without any hand-placed layers.
//
// It is confined to a narrow band of view directions around the horizon and
// early-outs above the tallest possible peak, so it touches a few per cent of the
// frame.
//
// Distances are in metres. The range sits from 9 km to 45 km, well beyond the
// 870 m clipmap, so nothing here can ever intersect the terrain.
