// surferFlowClipmap — vertex placement and displacement for the nested-ring terrain.
//
// The whole terrain is one static vertex buffer and one draw call. Vertices
// carry only a grid index and a ring level; where they actually land is decided
// here, every frame, from the camera position. Nothing is rebuilt on the CPU,
// nothing streams.
//
// Two things make this crack-free:
//
//  1. Each ring snaps its origin to twice its own vertex spacing, so the lattice
//     never slides underneath the geometry and the surface does not swim.
//
//  2. Vertices morph toward the *next coarser* lattice across the outer band of
//     their ring (CDLOD). By the ring boundary the morph is complete, so those
//     vertices sit exactly on the coarser ring's lattice and sample exactly the
//     same height. No T-junctions, and no popping when a ring re-snaps.
//
// Included by both the beauty pass and the shadow depth pass. They must produce
// bit-identical positions or the terrain would shadow-acne against itself, which
// is precisely why this is an include and not two copies.
