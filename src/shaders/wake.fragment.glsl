// The snow-surf wake — shading.
//
// This is snow that has just left the ground, and it is a different material from
// the field it came out of even though it is the same substance. Freshly broken
// snow is looser, brighter and rougher than the pack, and — the part that matters
// most here — it is *thin*. A wave crest is centimetres of powder held up in the
// air, so it transmits: with the sun low and behind it, the lip should light up
// from the inside rather than going to silhouette.
//
// So the subsurface term is driven off the section parameter rather than off a
// constant: thick and opaque at the base where the wall meets the trench, thin
// and glowing at the lip. That single gradient is most of what separates this
// from a white ribbon.
//
// Everything else — the cascades, the SH ambient, the glints, the aerial
// perspective — is the same code the snow field runs, out of the same includes.
// The wake has to sit in the frame as part of the same world.

    // lip's cast shadow lands metres away rather than on the face beneath it.
    // Every bit of the "inside the curl is dark" read therefore has to come from
    // here, and its absence is what made the first version look like a white
    // cut-out pasted over the snow.
    //
    //   base      the foot of the wall stands in the trench it came out of
    //   barrel    the concave side is enclosed by the overhang above it, and the
    //             harder the curl the less sky it sees
    // Only the inside of the curl, and nothing else.
    //
    // Every open face has to render at *exactly* the brightness of the snow it
    // was thrown out of, and the reason is the tonemapper rather than the
    // lighting. AgX desaturates hard as it approaches its shoulder, which is what
    // makes sunlit snow read as white despite being lit by a beam that is roughly
    // 17:13:6. Half a stop below that, the curve stops rolling the saturation off
    // and the same warm beam on the same white albedo comes back as tan. So a
    // broad, gentle darkening of the wall — which is what an ambient-occlusion
    // term looks like, and what two earlier passes here applied — does not read
    // as "slightly shaded snow". It reads as brown snow, next to white snow.

    // Two rules, both learned the hard way, and both about hue rather than
    // brightness:
    //
    //  1. It scales the *finished radiance*, not the ambient. The textbook AO
    //     scales ambient and leaves direct light alone, but in this scene the
    //     ambient is where all the blue lives — the sky is strongly blue-shifted
    //     by construction and the sun is a 13-degree beam at roughly 17:13:6.
    //     Attenuating one and not the other does not darken a surface, it
    //     re-weights a warm source against a cool one.
    //
    //  2. Wherever it *does* darken, it goes blue in proportion. A surface that
    //     dims without shifting hue drops below the tonemapper's desaturating
    //     shoulder still carrying the sun's warmth, and lands on tan. Snow does
    //     not do that: light reaching into a fold of snow has scattered through
    //     snow to get there, and snow absorbs red over any appreciable path,
    //     which is why a real snow cave is blue and not grey. Tying the tint to
    //     the darkening rather than to `barrel` directly means the two can never
