// Crystallise — ice shading.
//
// What sells this spell is not the geometry. It is that a facet of clear ice
// does three different things depending on where you stand relative to it, all at
// once and all sharply divided by the facet edges:
//
//   near grazing   almost a mirror. Fresnel at 0.02 base reflectance still
//                  returns nearly everything at 80 degrees, and against this
//                  scene's low warm sun that is a hard bright edge.
//   head on        you see through it, bent, and tinted by the path — which on a
//                  30 cm crystal is a real blue, because ice absorbs red about
//                  fifteen times faster than blue.
//   backlit        it glows. Ice scatters internally at every inclusion and
//                  bubble, and a crystal with the sun behind it lights up along
//                  its whole length rather than going to silhouette.
//
// **Blended, but depth-writing.** The usual pair of options is opaque (correct
// depth, no transparency) or alpha-blended with depth write off (transparency,
// no depth). Neither is right for a cluster of forty overlapping prisms: the
// first gives blue spikes, and the second gives a grey smear where every prism
// blends over every other one in index order.
//
// Writing depth while blending gives the third thing. The first surface at a
// pixel blends over whatever the terrain and the character already put there —
// so you genuinely see the snow through the ice — and every surface *behind* it
// is depth-rejected, so no crystal is ever blended over another one. The result
// is order-dependent in principle and completely stable in practice, because the
// only thing the order decides is which face of a solid you see, and any of them
// is a correct answer.
//
// The normal comes from the derivatives of the world position, so every facet is
// exactly flat and the edges between them are exactly hard. That hard edge is
// what makes the material read: adjacent facets of one prism return wildly
// different amounts of sky, and that facet-to-facet jump *is* the look of ice.
