// Contrast-adaptive sharpen, after the display transform.
//
// TAA costs sharpness — it is a weighted average over eight subpixel positions,
// and however good the neighbourhood clip is, the result is softer than the
// jittered frame that went in. This is the pass that buys it back, and it belongs
// at the very end for two reasons: sharpening in linear HDR puts a dark ring
// around every specular highlight, because the overshoot there is measured in
// stops rather than in code values; and the eye judges acutance after the tone
// curve, not before it.
//
// The local min/max clamp is what makes it "adaptive": the correction is limited
// to the range already present in the 3x3 neighbourhood, so a sharp edge is
// steepened and a flat expanse of snow does not gain a halo it has no gradient to
// justify.
