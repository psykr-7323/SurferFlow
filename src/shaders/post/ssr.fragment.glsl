// Screen-space reflections, on ice only.
//
// Reflections on wet and ice surfaces only, and on this content that qualifier
// is doing all the work. A snow field is a rough dielectric with a
// 0.028 F0 — there is nothing to reflect off it that the sky lookup in the
// material does not already give exactly. The one genuinely specular surface here
// is what Crystallise leaves behind: hexagonal prisms at roughness 0.07, and the
// glaze they write into the terrain state buffer's ice channel.
//
// So this pass is gated on the prepass mask, and the mask is non-zero on
// precisely those pixels. On every frame where nobody has cast Crystallise it
// costs one texture fetch and a branch, which is why it can afford to march at
// full resolution when it does fire.
//
// What it buys: the ice already reflects the *sky* correctly and cheaply. What it
// cannot know analytically is that there is a dune, a trench, or the character
// standing in the direction it is reflecting. That is the entire content of this
// pass — replace the sky estimate with what is actually there, where the march
// can find it.
