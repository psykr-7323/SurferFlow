// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Temporal anti-aliasing.
//
// The one post-process this content genuinely cannot do without. The snow
// material's whole detail budget is spent on
// things that live at or below the pixel: two octaves of discrete crystal glints,
// three tiled grain scales, sastrugi at a decimetre, a rotated Poisson shadow
// filter dithered per pixel, and a plume of two-centimetre grains. Every one of
// those is built to be *resolved* by an accumulation rather than to survive on
// its own — the glint hash is nailed to world space and the shadow rotation is
// interleaved-gradient noise precisely so that a temporal filter can integrate
// them. Without one, the field crawls.
//
// The reprojection is depth-based rather than motion-vector based, which is a
// deliberate trade. Almost everything on screen is static world geometry, so the
// camera's own motion accounts for essentially all the parallax; the character,
// the wake and the spray are small, fast and high-contrast, which is exactly the
// case the neighbourhood clip rejects history for anyway. A motion-vector buffer
// would be a second full-screen target and a velocity output in five vertex
// programs, to improve the one part of the frame that already refuses history.

/// The single largest quality decision in this file, and it is not about

/// fractional offset *every frame*, and each resample is fed back into the next,
/// so a bilinear tap does not soften the image once, it convolves it with a tent
/// kernel again and again. Standing still with a 0.9 feedback that is roughly ten
/// applications of it, and the result is a frame visibly softer than the one the
/// renderer produced — which on a field whose entire detail budget is
/// subpixel-scale is the difference between snow and a grey slope.
///
/// A bicubic B-spline fetch has negative lobes that undo most of that. Five
/// bilinear taps rather than sixteen point fetches, by folding each pair of
/// weights into one offset tap.
