// Volumetric light shafts.
//
// At a thirteen-degree sun these earn their cost: every dune crest in the frame
// is a horizon-line occluder with the sun sitting just above it, which is the
// geometry that produces shafts. The same effect at a midday sun would be
// invisible, and this is written so that it simply switches itself off there —
// the weight falls with the sun's screen distance and vanishes once the sun
// leaves the frustum.
//
// Occlusion comes from the depth prepass rather than a separate occlusion render:
// a pixel where the prepass wrote nothing is sky, and sky is where the beam gets
// through. That makes this a radial integral of sky visibility, and it costs one
// texture fetch per step with no extra geometry pass behind it.
//
// Runs at quarter resolution. Shafts are the lowest-frequency thing in the frame
// by an order of magnitude, and the composite reads this back bilinearly.
