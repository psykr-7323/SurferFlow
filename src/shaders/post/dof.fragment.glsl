// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Depth of field — very restrained.
//
// The focal plane tracks the character, because the character is what the player
// is looking at and the spring arm already knows how far away it is. Everything
// nearer than about half that distance and everything past roughly twice it
// picks up a circle of confusion, capped at a few pixels.
//
// The restraint is not timidity. This scene's depth cue is aerial perspective —
// contrast compression and a hue pull toward the sky — and that is a *physical*
// cue that survives at any focal length. A heavy defocus competes with it and
// wins, which trades a snow field that recedes for a snow field that is out of
// focus. What a light one adds is the last thing missing from the near field:
// the berm the camera is almost sitting on stops being as crisp as the ridge two
// hundred metres away, which is the read that makes a frame look photographed.
//
// Sample weighting is by the *sample's own* circle of confusion, so a blurred
// background cannot bleed onto a sharp foreground — the artefact that makes cheap
// depth of field look like a smeared decal around every silhouette.
