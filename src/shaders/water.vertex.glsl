// Spell water — vertex placement.
//
// The mesh carries no geometry. `position` is (column, ring, strand) and every
// vertex is placed here from the strand table, exactly as the wake and the spray
// billboards are. Eight strands share one static buffer and one draw.
//
// Normals are differenced out of `waterPoint` rather than derived analytically.
// The surface is a sweep with a per-sample radius, a transported frame, a
// vertical squash and three octaves of relief on top; the analytic normal for
// all of that is long and easy to get subtly wrong, and three extra evaluations
// cannot disagree with the geometry because they *are* the geometry.
//
// A strand that is not in use is switched off by having its table zeroed rather
// than by a branch: radius 0 puts every vertex of it on one point, every triangle
// then has zero area, and the rasteriser produces no fragments. That is cheaper
// than any test, and — more usefully — it means "how many spells are up" never
// changes which pipeline runs or how many draws there are.
