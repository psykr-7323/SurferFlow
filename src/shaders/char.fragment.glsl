// The fabric material — shared by the skinned body and the simulated garments.
//
// A plain PBR dielectric is the wrong model for cloth and looks it. Three terms
// carry the difference:
//
//   sheen        A retroreflective lobe from the fibres standing proud of the
//                surface. It is why wool has a bright *rim* rather than a
//                bright *highlight*, and it is the single term that stops this
//                reading as painted plastic. Charlie distribution, which is an
//                inverted Gaussian: energy piles up at grazing angles instead
//                of around the mirror direction.
//   anisotropy   The weave has a direction. A GGX lobe stretched along the warp
//                gives the soft directional streak real woven cloth has, and it
//                is what makes the mantle's shoulder read as a fabric plane and
//                not a shaded cylinder.
//   transmission Thin fabric over a lit edge glows. Same back-scatter term the
//                snow uses, which is not a coincidence — it is the same physics
//                at a different mean free path.
//
// On top of that a procedural weave supplies a normal and a cavity at a scale
// far below the geometry, faded out by pixel footprint so it never aliases.
//
// Everything downstream of the BRDF — cascade selection, PCSS, aerial
// perspective — is the identical code the snow runs, from shared includes. The
// character has to sit in the same light as the field or it will look pasted on
// no matter how good the fabric is.
