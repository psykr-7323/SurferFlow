// position packs the clipmap addressing: (gridI, ringLevel, gridJ).


/// Where the clipmap rings are centred — the *character*, not the camera.
///
/// This is the whole reason carved snow holds still while you orbit. Ring 0 is
/// 6.8 m of half-extent and the spring arm sits 3-11 m behind the character, so
/// centring on the camera put the snow directly under the player right on the
/// ring 0 / ring 1 boundary: swinging the camera round re-sampled it between
/// 0.085 m and 0.17 m spacing and the trail visibly changed shape. Centring on
/// the character makes vertex placement a function of world position and player
/// position only, so no camera motion can alter the geometry.
///
/// The cost is that the ground under a fully zoomed-out camera is one ring
/// coarser than it would otherwise be. The camera never leaves ring 1, and it is
/// looking away from that ground anyway.

    // Real displacement, not a normal-map trick: a trench the player can see the
    // far wall of, and berms that break the silhouette against the sky. The
    // fragment shader carries the sub-vertex detail on top.
    //
    // Reaches much further out than the fine layer above, and deliberately so.
    // Sastrugi is a 2 m wavelength at +/-12 cm, so past 0.42 m spacing it is
    // smaller than a triangle and there is nothing to be done but drop it. A
    // trail is the opposite shape of problem — half a metre wide but up to half a
    // metre deep — so it is worth displacing well past the point where the
    // lattice resolves its walls, provided it is band-limited on the way in.
    //
    // `deformHeight` does that filtering from `cv.spacing`, which is what keeps
    // the groove smooth instead of faceted when a ring boundary sweeps across it.
    // The remaining fade only cleans up the tail, where the filter has flattened
    // the trench to nearly nothing anyway.
    //
    // This gate and the filter argument must be mirrored exactly in
    // terrainDepth.vertex.glsl, or the terrain will shadow against a surface it
    // is not drawing.
