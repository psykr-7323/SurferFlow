// Spell water — shading.
//
// The one material in the demo that is not snow. Four things have to be true at
// once or it reads as a blue plastic tube, and they pull against each other:
//
//   it is transparent      You see the field through it, displaced, and the
//                          displacement is what says "this is a lens" rather
//                          than "this is a coloured surface".
//   it is coloured by
//   what it absorbs        Not by an albedo. Water's colour is the *shortfall*
//                          of the light that made it through — red first, then
//                          green — so the tint follows the path length and a
//                          thin wisp comes out nearly clear while the belly of
//                          a metre-wide column goes deep teal.
//   it is mirror-bright    At 13 degrees a wet surface returns almost all of a
//                          grazing view. Fresnel does most of the work of making
//                          it look wet, and it is what keeps a body legible
//                          against a pale sky.
//   it scatters inside     A body of water thrown through the air is full of
//                          bubbles and entrained snow, and that internal
//                          scatter is what keeps the shadowed side of an arc
//                          alive.
//
// **Refraction without a scene copy.** The obvious implementation samples the
// framebuffer behind the surface, which means rendering the opaque pass twice or
// copying a bound render target mid-frame. Neither is necessary here, because of
// what is actually behind the water: sky, or snow, and nothing else. The sky LUT
// already stores both — the Nishita bake writes the iteratively-solved snow
// bounce into every direction below the horizon, precisely so that shadowed snow
// can be lit by the ground it sits on. So a single lookup along the refracted ray
// returns a physically-derived estimate of what is behind the water for *any*
// direction, up or down, at the cost of one texture fetch. Three fetches at three
// slightly different indices of refraction give the chromatic dispersion.
//
// What it cannot show is the specific dune or trail behind the water. At the
// distance and speed these effects are seen at, that is a trade worth making
// twice over: it is exact in hue and energy, it never breaks, it never has to be
// re-ordered against the transparent pass, and it costs three samples of a
// texture the shader is already binding.
