// deformSim — the terrain state buffer.
//
// One full-screen pass per frame, ping-ponged between two RGBA16F targets. It
// does four jobs in one dispatch, in this order:
//
//   1. scroll   the window follows the player toroidally; texels that just came
//               into view are zeroed rather than showing whatever was there
//               half a field away.
//   2. relax    diffusion + berm slump + slow decay. This is the "refill": trails
//               soften and eventually heal, but slowly enough that a run is still
//               obviously there a minute later.
//   3. splat    every brush written this frame — footfalls, the surf wake, every
//               spell — accumulated additively.
//   4. clamp    depression bottoms out (you hit packed snow), berms cap.
//
// Channels:
//   R  depression depth, metres, positive = pushed down
//   G  displaced mass,   metres, positive = piled up. This is the channel that
//      separates a trail with berms from a flat footprint decal.
//   B  compression 0..1 — denser, darker, tighter specular, scatters less
//   A  ice 0..1 — refrozen, smooth and reflective
//
// Addressing is toroidal: a texel's UV is fract(worldXZ / size), so the buffer
// never needs copying when the player moves. The seam therefore sits at the far
// edge of the window, ~32 m from the player, where a one-texel bilinear artefact
// is not resolvable.

        // A 400-second time constant is a per-frame multiply by 0.999985 at
        // 165 FPS. Half float carries an 11-bit significand, so one ULP near 0.5
        // is a relative 4.9e-4 — thirty times *larger* than the 1.5e-5 the decay
        // is trying to subtract. Every store therefore lands between two
        // representable values, and because the product is always slightly below
        // the input it consistently resolves to the lower one: the buffer loses a
        // full ULP per frame instead of the sliver it asked for.
        //
        // That is a decay of 2^-11 per frame — about 8% per second, a ten-second
        // half-life, entirely independent of the constant written here and
        // proportional to frame rate. It is why three rounds of retuning these
        // numbers changed the measured decay by nothing at all, and why setting
        // refillRate to 0 (which makes exp() return exactly 1) froze the buffer
        // solid. Banking the time and spending it in steps of ~0.4 s puts each
